Help me understand Fedora RPM recipe (distribution/rpm/README.md) for QR Code & Barcode Scanner, the open-source scanner. Source documentation; publication is not implied. Provided README context (verify against the sources): Use this recipe to create Fedora RPMs around the official GNU/Linux CLI while keeping the upstream executable unchanged. The local build and consumer checks establish what that package contains and runs. They do not establish a Fedora COPR repository, its ownership or public catalogue admission. Read the public documentation below. Explain what this destination does, its documented installation or access steps, a minimal example if supported, prerequisites, limitations and license. Distinguish published packages from working source and preparation. Cite your sources; if a page is unavailable or a fact cannot be checked, say so. Do not invent installation commands, benchmark results or comparisons. Answer in my language. Public sources: https://github.com/qrcode-ai-com/qrcode-barcode-scanner/blob/main/distribution/rpm/README.md https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/qr-code-scanner https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/barcode-scanner https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/qr-code-scanner/cli https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/barcode-scanner/cli https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/qr-code-generator https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/barcode-generator

Use this recipe to create Fedora RPMs around the official GNU/Linux CLI while keeping the upstream executable unchanged. The local build and consumer checks establish what that package contains and runs. They do not establish a Fedora COPR repository, its ownership or public catalogue admission.

The [QR code scanner](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/qr-code-scanner) and [barcode scanner](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/barcode-scanner) are QR Code AI’s browser scanning entry points. For the corresponding development route, the [QR code scanner command line guide](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/qr-code-scanner/cli) and [barcode scanner command line guide](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/barcode-scanner/cli) connect this documentation to the two product journeys. If a product page is unavailable, the instructions and references in this README remain the starting point for this source directory.

To prepare a known label for the installed Fedora command, use the [QR code generator](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/qr-code-generator) or the [barcode generator](https://qrcode-ai.com/en-US/barcode-generator). Keep the original payload with the exported image so that you can compare the scan result with the value you intended to encode.

This recipe packages the official scanner 0.11.0 GNU/Linux CLI for Fedora.
The executable stays byte-identical to the published `qrscan` on x86_64 and
aarch64. The package includes the licenses, notices, and source reference.

## Build

Use Fedora 44 with `rpm-build`, `coreutils`, `gzip`, and `tar` installed.
Download both GNU/Linux archives and the corresponding source archive from
the [engine release](https://github.com/qrcode-ai-com/qrcode-barcode-scanner/releases/tag/v0.11.0).
Place the three files under a fresh RPM top directory and build on the desired
architecture:

```sh
mkdir -p "$PWD/rpm-build/SOURCES"
# Copy the three engine archives to rpm-build/SOURCES.
rpmbuild -ba --define "_topdir $PWD/rpm-build" distribution/rpm/qrcode-barcode-scanner.spec
```

The spec pins the SHA-256 of all three inputs and verifies the selected
executable before packaging. The source RPM includes the same three archives
and spec for an offline rebuild. The binary RPM contains a link to the
[corresponding source](https://github.com/qrcode-ai-com/qrcode-barcode-scanner/releases/download/v0.11.0/qrcode-barcode-scanner-cli-0.11.0-source.tar.gz).

## Install and test

On Fedora 44, choose the RPM for your architecture and verify it against the
SHA-256 manifest that accompanies the release. The package revision is
`0.11.0-1.fc44` and the CLI reports `qrscan 0.11.0`.

```sh
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing qrcode-barcode-scanner-rpm-0.11.0-1.fc44-SHA256SUMS
sudo dnf install "./qrcode-barcode-scanner-0.11.0-1.fc44.$(uname -m).rpm"
qrscan --version
```

Download the [mixed fixture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qrcode-ai-com/qrcode-barcode-scanner/v0.11.0/fixtures/symbology/mixed-code128-qr.png)
as `mixed-code128-qr.png`. The report for each profile contains the QR URL
`https://qrc-ai.com/76xMa` and the Code 128 value `STOCK-4827`. The CLI runs
locally.

```sh
for profile in fast frame full; do
  qrscan mixed-code128-qr.png --profile "$profile" --budget-ms 0
done
sudo dnf remove qrcode-barcode-scanner
```

Published archives retain the license shipped with their version. A pinned engine, adapter or bundle may therefore have different terms from this working source.
